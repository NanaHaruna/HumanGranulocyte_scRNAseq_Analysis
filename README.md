 ### [scRNA-seq profiling of human granulocytes reveals expansion of developmentally flexible neutrophil precursors with mixed neutrophil and eosinophil properties in asthma](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38814679/)

<h2>Description</h2>
This project consists of the scripts used in the analysis in this research paper. I have provided notes and the codes detailing what each step is doing. The goal was to analyze immune cells (neutrophils and eosinophils - granulocytes) from different human tissues i.e. bone marrow and blood and examine the different subsets of immune cells that exist in healthy versus asthmatic conditions. The analysis was performed by integrating multiple samples from different patients into one object. I provide steps for initial scRNA seq analysis, visualization, trajectory analysis, etc.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
Neutrophils and eosinophils share common hematopoietic precursors and usually diverge into distinct lineages with unique markers before being released from their hematopoietic site, which is the bone marrow (BM). However, previous studies identified an immature Ly6g(+) Il-5RÎ±(+) neutrophil population in mouse BM, expressing both neutrophil and eosinophil markers suggesting hematopoietic flexibility. Moreover, others have reported neutrophil populations expressing eosinophil-specific cell surface markers in tissues and altered disease states, confusing the field regarding eosinophil origins, function, and classification. Despite these reports, it is still unclear whether hematopoietic flexibility exists in human granulocytes. To answer this, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and CITE-seq to profile human BM and circulating neutrophils and eosinophils at different stages of differentiation and determine whether neutrophil plasticity plays role in asthmatic inflammation. We show that immature metamyelocyte neutrophils in humans expand during severe asthmatic inflammation and express both neutrophil and eosinophil markers. We also show an increase in tri-lobed eosinophils with mixed neutrophil and eosinophil markers in allergic asthma and that IL-5 promotes differentiation of immature blood neutrophils into tri-lobed eosinophilic phenotypes suggesting a mechanism of emergency granulopoiesis to promote myeloid inflammatory or remodeling response in patients with chronic asthma. By providing insights into unexpectedly flexible granulocyte biology and demonstrating emergency hematopoiesis in asthma, our results highlight the importance of granulocyte plasticity in eosinophil development and allergic diseases.
